      <p>10. Fried Egg <br>
Fried Eggs on a burger can be extraodinary but only in specific circumstances, I don’t feel like I always want this on a burger either. It also needs other toppings. <br> <br>
 9. Jack Browns Sauce <br>
This could easily compete for a top 3 spot if this sauce was more widely available, Jack Browns not being a chain is the only thing that holds this back.</p>

    <p>8. Pickles <br>
Pickles are an incredible complimentary topping but a very average, and unimpactful when alone. Pickles also range in terms of quality and that also negatively affects this. <br> <br>
7. Sauteed Mushrooms <br>
I feel like I may have these too low but they like pickles can also range in terms of quality, which holds it back. They also need other toppings sometimes, and they also limit how much burger you can eat if they’re too rich.</p>

  <div class="sixfive">
    <img src="./assets/bacon.png" alt="bacon">
    <p>6. Mayonaise <br>
Just for clarification Jack Browns Sauce>Mayo. But you can get Mayo anywhere whereas JB’s sauce is limited, and Mayo is maybe the best complimentary topping, and it’s certainly not below average by itself. <br> <br>
5.Bacon <br>
Bacon’s pretty self-explanatory, it’s good on anything and it’s almost impossible to make it worse than good, but you can elevate if you smoke it or add brown sugar or something. Some people will say I have it too low but it’s not as impactful as others above it.</p>

  <div class="fourthree">
    <img src="./assets/tomato.png" alt="tomato">
    <img src="./assets/lettuce.png" alt="lettuce">
    <p>4.Tomato <br>
Tomato is probably the best complimentary topping, up there with Mayo, but its more impactful than mayo by itself. It’s also hard to mess up a tomato on a burger as long as the tomato is ripe, and a really really good tomato on a burger is incredible. <br> <br>
3.Lettuce <br>
Lettuce like tomato is a great compliment, but lettuce is a little better by itself and not only is really good in and of itself but it can elevate a dry burger to being a lot better. </p>

    <p>2.Toasted Bun <br>
If you dont toast your bun on a burger what are you doing. It’s simply classless not too, everything about toasting a bun is better, the flavor, the texture, the consistency, it keeps your hands cleaner, toasted buns are 100% necessary on a burger. <br> <br>
1.Caramelized Onions <br>
Caramelized Onions like a toasted bun are a necessity on a burger, their incredible when done right and add so much to a burger. They go with any other toppings and are great by themselves. </p>
